# Workout Tracker API

## LINK TO THE API :

https://exercise-log-app-backend-dev.herokuapp.com/

## TECHNOLOGIES USED :

* Express
* Node
* Javascript
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Postman

## PROJECT SUMMARY :

Created and api that allows an application to be able to use user authentication and in session update, create and delete. Created full CRUD API, using REST architecture style.

## APPROACH TAKEN :

Created the api in express, since only the data of the API was presented and there was no user functionality, the api was tested on Postman. Postman gave us the oppurtunity to test all CRUD functionality.

## DIFFICULTIES

- Some merge conflicts with the schema
- How tokens are getting saved on local.
